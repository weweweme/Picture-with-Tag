# wxWidgets

## Description
- wxWidgets is an open-source GUI toolkit written in C++.

## Features
- Platform Independence: wxWidgets supports the construction of GUI applications across various operating systems.
- Open Source: The source code is publicly available, allowing users to use and modify it for free.

## Reasons for Use
- It enables the implementation of programs that operate on multiple platforms using a single codebase.
- Being open source, it is cost-free.

## Application in the Project
- GUI Development
    - Enables consistent and intuitive user interfaces across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    - Provides tools and widgets that facilitate the design and implementation of user interfaces, such as buttons, dialogs, and frames.



# Boost

## Description
- Boost is a comprehensive collection of libraries focused on extending the C++ standard library.

## Features
- Comprehensive Functionality: Provides a wide range of features including smart pointers, file system support, and random number generation.
- Template-Centric: Maximizes the use of template programming, enhancing code reuse and flexibility. However, this can also lead to complexity and increased compilation times.
- Dependency Management: Libraries may be tightly coupled, requiring the inclusion of multiple other libraries to use a particular feature. 

## Reasons for Use
- Due to its serialization capabilities. Boost's serialization module simplifies the complex tasks of storing and retrieving object states via files or networks.
- The project's scale is not large, so the increase in compilation time due to templates is not a significant issue.
- Dependency Management: Although Boost's library dependencies can be complex, the small scale of the project and the ability to selectively include only needed features minimize unnecessary dependencies.

## Boost Serialization in the Project

### Overview
- Boost Serialization is extensively used in the project to efficiently manage and serialize DataItem class instances.
- Facilitates storage, loading, and data management without reliance on external file systems.
- Directly enhances performance and maintainability by streamlining data handling processes.

### Key Components and Functions
- Class Definition
    - The DataItem class includes members such as title, tags, body, and image_data.
    - Boost's serialize function is implemented to enable serialization of these members, allowing private access via the friend class declaration.
- Custom Serialization for wxString
    - Custom save and load functions are defined for wxString using Boost's split_free method, which handles conversion between wxString and std::string for serialization purposes.
- Data Loading and Saving:
    - DataManager class handles data item loading with LoadDataItems and saving with SaveDataItem.
    - Utilizes boost::archive::text_iarchive for loading and boost::archive::text_oarchive for saving, streamlining data serialization directly from and to memory.

### Application in the Project
- The use of Boost Serialization simplifies the handling of complex data types and ensures consistent data processing across platforms.
- It enhances application performance by enabling efficient data management, crucial for applications requiring stable data storage and rapid loading.
