# wxWidgets

## Description
- wxWidgets is an open-source GUI toolkit written in C++.

## Features
- Platform Independence: wxWidgets supports the construction of GUI applications across various operating systems.
- Open Source: The source code is publicly available, allowing users to use and modify it for free.

## Reasons for Use
- It enables the implementation of programs that operate on multiple platforms using a single codebase.
- Being open source, it is cost-free.


# Boost

## Description
- Boost is a comprehensive collection of libraries focused on extending the C++ standard library.

## Features
- Comprehensive Functionality: Provides a wide range of features including smart pointers, file system support, and random number generation.
- Template-Centric: Maximizes the use of template programming, enhancing code reuse and flexibility. However, this can also lead to complexity and increased compilation times.
- Dependency Management: Libraries may be tightly coupled, requiring the inclusion of multiple other libraries to use a particular feature. 

## Reasons for Use
- Due to its serialization capabilities. Boost's serialization module simplifies the complex tasks of storing and retrieving object states via files or networks.
- The project's scale is not large, so the increase in compilation time due to templates is not a significant issue.
- Dependency Management: Although Boost's library dependencies can be complex, the small scale of the project and the ability to selectively include only needed features minimize unnecessary dependencies.
